            <h2>Lord of the Rings
                By J.R.R. Tolkien</h2>
           <p>This high-fantasy novel is a famous three volume epic. It centers around an all powerful ring forged by the Dark Lord Sauron. For many years the ring is sought after by all likes, but at the start of the novel, it resides in the simple home of the hobbit Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo sets a momentous quest upon his cousin Frodo’s shoulders, tasking him with the journey to Mount Doom to destroy the ring. <br>
            Tolkein’s world-building is deep and rich. He creates languages in his stories that can even be learned by some of the more devoted readers. It’s not just a story that he’s crafting, but a home.

        <h2>Turning Points-:TO Kill a Mockingbird</h2>
        <p>To Kill a Mockingbird, by Harper Lee
            Harper Lee’s classic is one those rare perfect novels, which by itself makes it a should read. It’s further elevated by the evergreen nature of its central conflicts and plot; nearly six decades after publication, the story of a small southern town’s struggle with racism and injustice remains disturbingly current. It’s also become a must read because it’s widely the quintessential 20th-century American novel.

         <h2>The Power of Subconscious Mind-: DR JOSEPH MURPHY</h2>
         <p>This is a short and simple book. I didn't have much expectation going into it, but I was pleasantly surprised. 
             First, the writer explains the difference between the conscious and subconscious mind and 
             what role is played by both of them. Then, he makes a very good case by giving us examples by stating 
             the reason our subconscious mind plays a vital role in shaping our life. It got me hooked. 
             It's been said and done and it's nothing I haven't heard before but I was compelled to try out some of the 
             the exercises myself like writing positive affirmations and memorizing them everyday. It's a fun activity and by no means, 
             it'll lead to anything unless you take conscious steps towards your goal which is very important. The approach is positive, 
             effective and motivating.

       <h2>Believe In Yourself-: DR.JOSEPH MURPHY</h2>
       <p>Dr Joseph Murphy was the author of The Power of your Subconscious Mind. In Believe in Yourself Dr. 
           Murphy shows you how the power of believing in yourself will help you achieve your dreams. 
           He illustrates his points with wonderful stories about how inventors, writers, artists, and 
           entrepreneurs have used this power to reach the highest of heights. By the end of the book 
           you will have the tools for success. There are many men who quietly use the abstract term success, over and 
           over many times a day until they reach a conviction that success is theirs. As a man repeats the word success to himself 
           with faith and conviction, his subconscious mind will accept it as true of himself, and he will be 
           under subjective compulsion to succeed. - Joseph Murphy
